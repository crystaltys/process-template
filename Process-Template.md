## Project Planning

| Details of tickets (ownership, milestones, issue type, priority etc.) are complete in the issue management system.  Milestones exist for each iteration of the project with associated tickets. |

| Tickets frequently updated during the course of the iteration as tasks are completed. New tickets are created as needed throughout the iteration. |

| Realistic estimates of the effort required for the latest iteration were made, such that all objectives were achieved; or the team actively manage the project plan and identify low priority tasks to be removed from the iteration. |

## Quality Assurance

| Every commit to master (at least) is tested in a continuous integration environment by executing an automated regression test suite. |

| The team immediately fixed any broken builds report by the CI environment and no new features are added until this is done. |
